# Marvel_Characters_Dataset_Analysis_PySpark_Colab
Cleaning and exploring the Marvel Characters Dataset using PySpark on Google Colab.

Welcome to the Marvel Characters Data Analysis project! In this repository, we explore and analyze the Marvel Characters Dataset using PySpark within the Google Colab environment. Our goal is to gain insights into the characteristics and attributes of Marvel characters through data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

## Dataset
The Marvel Characters Dataset provides a comprehensive collection of information about various characters from the Marvel universe, including their Name, Alignment, Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Power, Combat, and Total.
## Tools and Technologies
- PySpark: PySpark is a powerful Python API for Apache Spark for distributed data processing and analysis, which we leverage for efficient data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks.
- Google Colab: Google Colab offers a collaborative and cloud-based environment for running Python code, making it ideal for data analysis projects like ours.
- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Project Structure
- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project, dataset, tools, and project structure.
- `characters_stats_dataset.zip `: This zip file contains the dataset.
- `Marvel_characters.ipynb`: This is the Google Colab file used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1.	Download the ‘Marvel_characters.ipynb’ file to your local machine and import in to either a Jupyter notebook or Google colaboratory.
2.	Download the .zip file and extract it to your local machine.
3.	In the Google colab, import the dataset by clicking on the ‘file’ icon on the left-side-pane.
4.	In the 5th code block of the colab file, edit the file path of your dataset. 
5.	Run the cells in the order given to import the necessary libraries and preserve the logical order of execution.
